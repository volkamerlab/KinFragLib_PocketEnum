# Project Structure Refractoring

## Configuration
Collect the conifgurations from the config file to reduce this overload of arguments for different functions + config handling is not performed in main
- [] class config
- [] parse function
- [] config file is placed in config folder (maybe)
- [] parameters that target the program directly should be passed via cmd-line argument (number of threads, flexx, hyde)

## Class structure 
Divide classes in different folders
